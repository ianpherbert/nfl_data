## Project Overview

Welcome to the nfl_data project! This repository houses a collection of scripts dedicated to managing and analyzing NFL player data. Specifically, the player.ipynb notebook serves as a foundational, experimental workspace for collecting, processing, and experimenting with raw data. The scripts within are intended for further development and refinement.
Purpose of player.ipynb

- Initial Data Exploration: This notebook provides a first look at available NFL player data.
- Script Development: The existing code serves as a basic framework to build upon, refine, and customize.
- Flexible Analysis: By providing raw scripts, this notebook encourages custom data processing workflows.

## Usage Notes

- In Progress: The code is under active development. Expect changes as the data structure and desired analyses evolve.
- Customization: Users are encouraged to adapt and expand the scripts to meet specific needs.

## Next Steps

- Enhancements: Further develop the data collection and analysis processes.
- Documentation: Add detailed descriptions and comments for clarity

We welcome contributions to enhance and refine this tool!
